# Diagram specification (taken straight from the exercise)

You will need to draw a diagram of at least three host machines in a Kubernetes cluster. The cluster is running two applications. The applications can be anything you want. An example could be a videogame server and a blog website.

The applications may utilize other machines or APIs that are not part of the cluster. At least three of the machines should be utilized. Include "your own computer" in the diagram as the one sending instructions via kubectl to deploy an application. In addition include a HTTP message coming from the internet to your Kubernetes cluster and how it may reach an application.

Make sure to label the diagram so that anyone else who has completed this exercise, and read the glossary, would understand it. The diagram should contain at least four of the following labels: Pod, Cluster, Container, Service and a Volume.
